# 3rd Party Instagram Service

3rd Party RESTFUL Instagram Service / Bash

Instagram changed their policy a while ago as it forces you to login if you try to view an account information without logging in. So you can use this service script to create an unofficial basic RESTFUL API for Instagram.

Edit the shell script with your own session-id belongs to your Instagram account. Config an apache server to run .php script. Do not forget that the session-id of your account will be expired one year later.
